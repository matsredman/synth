# synth

Description: This is a two week project made by Mats Redman, Lisa Henriksson and Christoffer TÃ¶rnroos.
Written in C++ through the online compiler mbed (at mbed.com) and sent to the nucleon card.
Hardware used: Nucleon f302r8 card, 12 potentiometers, 5 buttons.

It's a bass synthesizer(between ~ 40 - 320 Hz) with two oscillators. One square wave, one saw wave. Each oscillator has a frequency, tempo, attack, 
decay, sustain and release potentiometer. Each potentiometer can be adjusted in real-time while sound is playing.
Each button can be pressed/unpressed in real-time while sound is playing.
The oscillators can be synced both through tempo and/or frequency.
